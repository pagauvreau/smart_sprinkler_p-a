Note:  For convenience, some of the pictures are from the 8 or a 24 Zone System.  This will not affect your ability to complete the project.



## **Hello, Smarter Lawn**
## **Building A 16 Zone Smarter Lawn Irrigation Controller**


### **A project by Stan Dotson (stan@dotson.info) and Matthew Nichols (matt@nichols.name)**

## Background

Why would you build a lawn sprinkler system controller when you can just buy one?  But you can’t just buy one... at least not the sprinkler system we were thinking about!!  Let’s start by first making the controller connected.  And of course, we will need iPhone controls.  Then we need to make it smart.  Smart like it knows when it has rained, is raining or will rain!   And then what if we could add cognition so that it actually learns how to water your lawn!  Not that would be really smart!!!

## High Level Project Steps

1. Order the hardware
2. Add SmartThings hub to your home network, download app to your iPhone
3. Obtain a Maker/Developer account for SmartThings (graph.api.smartthings.com)
4. Assemble the Arduino controller, ThingShield and 8 Channel Relay.  
5. Get the software.  Download the Arduino developer environment and import the irrigation controller sketch as well as the required libraries for SmartThings and the Timer library.  
6. Install the program code on the Arduino
7. Add Arduino to your SmartThings hub using your iPhone app
8. Go to graph.api.smartthings.com
  1. On My Device Types, create a new device type and paste in the device type code.  Save & Publish
  2. On My SmartApps, create a new Smart App and paste in the smart app code. Save & Publish
9.  Go to My Devices, select the Arduino and edit the Device Type and select the Irrigation Controller device handler
10. From your the SmartThings app on your SmartPhone, find your "sprinkler" system and open the Device Handler. Click on the "sprocket" icon in the top right corner and manually enter times for each of your zones.
11. Go ahead and test our your project by activating each zone, watch for the LED's to light on your boards and listen for a click when the relay activates.  If everything checks out, you are ready to connect the project to your irrigation system.
11.  Wire the Arduino to your irrigation system
12.  Test out system by manually pressing each of the tiles and confirming your zones activate

You now have a smarter lawn!


## The Hardware

All items from this project were easily obtained from Amazon and mostly available via Amazon Prime

### An Arduino with SmartThing Shield

An **Arduino MEGA* was used as the controller and was stacked with the SmartThings ThingShield.  *Note, set the DIP switch to D2/D3 if not already*.

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/4689513/665f710a-56be-11e4-9c37-ec0ade60d44b.jpg" width="200px"  />

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/3353577/8256ee78-fa85-11e3-93c8-866ef2ca9967.jpg" width="200px"  />

### Relays

To control the sprinkler valves, we used a **16 Channel Relay Board**.  You can also use 2x 8 Channel Relay Boards,  you will just have to wire them up in serial.  Special Note: the relays for sale online can be +5V, +12V, +24V.  The SIMPLEST thing to do was to buy +5V relays so that you can power directly from the Arduino.  Since only one (up to three if you add a pump and master valve) relays are on at any given time, the Arduino is able to power them.   

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/4689508/664a04fa-56be-11e4-9de9-37bd043f8fc1.jpg" width="200px"  />

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/3353578/86de7d94-fa85-11e3-86b9-b3b08601987f.jpg" width="200px"  />

### Wiring

For the wiring, we ordered both **20 cm dupont cable male to female** and **20 cm dupont cable female to female** (RioRand 3 x 40P 20cm Dupont Wire Jumper Cable 2.54 1P-1P Male-Male/Female-Female/Female-Male or similar from Amazon).  We liked this cable since the wires are organized as a ribbon cable which keeps the project neat.  We also used individual male to male jumper cables to wire the “COMMON” contacts together in parallel (see below).  We found these at Amazon such as **Male to Male Solderless Flexible Breadboard Jumper Cable Wires 65Pcs for Arduino by Sunkee**.

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/3353583/b426908e-fa85-11e3-81de-3c7b55a1db92.jpg" width="200px"  />

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/3353586/c2ceb562-fa85-11e3-9a2a-df5ed5e429cb.jpg" width="200px"  />

### Power Supplies

#### To run the sprinkler valves:
The project requires at least two power supplies.  One power supply is to run the sprinkler valves which are typically 24V AC.   The **Rain Bird UT1 Sprinkler System Timer Electric Transformer Plug** is a good choice from Amazon Prime.  

#### To power the Arduino, ThingShield and Relays:

*If your relays are 24V or 12V*  This is the recommended solution.  In this solution, the power to the Relay Board power is used to power the Arduino/ThingShield.  Purchase the respective power supply from Amazon.  We used 24V relays and purchased **100-240V to 24V 2A Switching AC/DC Power Adapter Charger US Plug by Gino** power supply.  We also used an adapter to make a clean transition from the power supply to flexible jumper wires.  The adapter can be found on Ebay or Amazon **10 Pack 2.1mm x 5.5mm Female CCTV Power Jack Adapter**  The 16 channel 24V relay board used in this project provide a +5V current that can be used to power the Arduiono+ThingShield (see below for wiring).

*If your relays are 5V:* You will need a 9V power supply to run the Arduino+ThingShield+Relays.  In this solution, the Arduino power is used to power the 5V relays (you use a jumper to connect the 5V pin and the VCC pin on the relay board).  This works because at most 2 relays are on at once (one for the valve and the other for the optional pump).   This can be purchased at Amazon as well by searching for "Arduino Power Supply".  Right now, I am using the Super Power Supply® AC / DC Adapter Charger Cord Plug - 9V 650mA compatible with Arduino Freeduino Duemilanove Uno Mega Hobby Electronics, which was available by Amazon Prime.   CAUTION: There are 9V power supplies availble on Amazon that do not work for the Arduino (they are made for musical instrament controllers) and some that perform very poorly on Arduino.  Be sure to read the reviews! 


### Project Housing
Finally, for the project housing, the 9"x9"x3" OUTDOOR CABLETEK ENCLOSURE PLASTIC GRAY CASE UTILITY CABLE BOX CTE-S from Amazon was a nice size that housed all the relay boards, as well as the Arduino+ThingShield. 

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/4667478/5eee633e-555d-11e4-88fd-ced3e1fa7f52.jpg" width="200px"  />

If you are interested in 3D printing the housing, you might try searching on ThingVerse.  There are a number of 3D projects that would house this project.

## Wiring the Project

* Wiring diagrams are included in the header of the Arduino sketch.

Here is an overview of the project all wired up and placed in the suggested housing:


<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/4691623/44894b36-5728-11e4-9674-c059561ec71a.jpg" width="200px"  />



### Wiring The Arduino Controller

Stack the SmartThing ThingShield on top of the Arduino MEGA.  

Arduino Mega and ThingShield Connections: 
We will be using the Hardware Serial 3 to drive communications with the ThingShield.

* Be sure the DIP switch on the ThingShield is set to D2/D3
* Connect a jumper from Pin2 to Pin14 (Tx->Tx)
* Connect a jumper from Pin3 to Pin15 (Rx->Rx)

We also need to run power from the Relay Board to the Arduino Mega

* Run jumper from the 5V pin on Relay Board to the +5V on the Arduino. 
* Run a jumper from GND on the Relay Board to the Arduino

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/14973958/998baa60-10b4-11e6-8cf9-cbfc58161e46.jpg" width="200px"  />


Jumper connections originating from the MEGA that will connect to the relay boards:

Use 16 wires from your ribbon cable to connect pins 21-36 on Arduino MEGA to pins 1 to 16 on the relay 16 channel board (or other scenarios depending on what combination of relay boards that you have purchased).

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/4689512/665d067c-56be-11e4-9348-c184c0246678.jpg" width="200px"  />

Jumper connections from the MEGA terminating on the 16 channel relay:

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/4689510/664f5b62-56be-11e4-8b00-f5e0f60c44dc.jpg" width="200px"  />

### Wiring The Relay Boards

In addition to making the connections between the Arduino MEGA and the relay pins (above), you also need to power the relay boards and connect the "Common" terminals between all 16 of the relays.  

####Powering the Relays:
The relays are potentiated by connections with the ARDUINO MEGA pins 21-36.  However, the actual relay switching is seperately powered by either a 5V, 12V or 24V DC power, depending on which relay you purchase. If using a +5V relays, run jumpers from the +5V and GND pins on the Arduino to the VCC and GND pins on the Relay Board, respectively.  If applicable move the jumper on the relay board that bridges VCC to JD-VCC.

####Connecting a Common terminals across the relays.
Using short male to male jumper flexible wires or pre-formed solid male-to-male jumper wire or combination, we daisy chained the COMMON contact positions together across all 16 relays.

Example of daisy chaining the COMMON terminals of the relays using flexible jumper wire:

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/3353593/f3f9b8f8-fa85-11e3-877c-f05b27e22214.jpg" width="200px"  />

Example of daisy chaining the COMMON terminals of the relays using pre-formed solid wire:

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/4689509/664cba06-56be-11e4-834b-1b57f8e895f2.jpg" width="200px"  />


Note, the ThingShield pins are not labeled.  So you can either identify the pins using labels on the Arduino or from the Arduino pic above
7. Connect the Arduino to USB power or to a 9V power supply using the appropriate ports.  
8. When not using the USB power supply, place a piece of black electrical tape over the USB port to prevent accidental shorting


### Wiring The Controller To The Irrigation System
The final wiring of the project to your irrigation system is straight forward.  Irrigation sytems use a standard irrigation wire bundle which has multiple colored wires (one per valve + extras) and a white wire as a common ground. They typically run on 24V AC power.  

* Be sure power is disconnected before attempting to wire. Avoid being shocked or creating a fire hazard!  


We connected “ground” wire from the 24V AC transformer to the common ground (white) wire in the irrigation wire bundle.

To connect the wires running to each valve, we used the Normally Open positions on the relay.  Each colored wire for each valve was connected to one of the NO positions on a relay.  One valve per relay.   Up to 16 are possible with this project, however, you do not need to use all 16.  We then connected the “hot” wire from the transformer to connect to the COMMON position (middle contact) on one of the relays.  This provides power to all realys since they are daisy chained together (see Arduino wiring above)  


<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/3353611/6b78fc9a-fa86-11e3-9557-424b4a2bf896.jpg" width="200px"  />

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/3353626/d163cc06-fa86-11e3-8aaf-c4a65fc64b5e.jpg" width="200px"  />

###OPTIONAL: Connect additional relay to activate a master valve or pump

If your irrigation system requires a pump to be turned on or a master valve to be opened, then there are two options for you.  A) you can wire the master valve or connect the pumps relay connector to the 8th relay on the 8-relay board.  B) you can purchase a single relay (find on Amazone) and add it to your controller.  

To add an additional single relay:
1. Connect the ground (GND) of the additional relay to one of the additional GND terminals on the Arduino.  There is one right next to the GND pin used to wire the 8-channel relay.
2. You will need to splice your 5V jumper (create a Y connection using a wire nut or slice connector) so that you can feed 5V both to your 8-channel relay and your single relay.  There is only one 5V pin on the Arduino
3. Go ahead and daisy chain the common port on the relay with the common port on the 8th relay on the 8-channel relay
4. In the Arduino sketch, set isPin13Pump = true to activate optional single Master Valve Pump Start Relay

Wiring the master valve or the pump relay:

Warning: Connecting a Pump Start Relay is potentially dangerous 
Warning: Pumps run on 120V or 220V power and incorrect wiring could result in lethal shock or fire hazard!
Warning: Work is best done by licensed electrician following local codes.

1. You should only be wiring the Pump Start Relay which uses 24V current.  Do not connect the 120V/240V wires!
2. Wire the ground wire from the Pump Start Relay to the  ground wire bundle that contains the ground wire from the 24V irrigation transformer/power supply and the common ground that runs to the irrigation valves.
3. Attach the load wire from the Pump Start Relay to Relay 16 or to the single relay that you added to the system, depending if you set up A) or B) above.
4. In scenario A), where you use relay 16 to control your pump, you need to switch the use of the relay in the device type software by tapping the pump tile.  See above to activate scenario B) by modifying the Arduino sketch. 

## The Software

The code for this project is in a few files which are posted on github:

**https://github.com/d8adrvn/smart_sprinkler**

### Arduino Code 

**(Arduino_16_Zone_Irrigation_Controller.ino)**

In its most basic form, our controller manages a queue and turns on/off switches. That’s it. Nothing else. All other features are in the cloud!

Managing the queue only needs a few basic functions:

1. Add or remove one or all irrigation zones to the queue
2. Ensure only one zone is on at a time (need a traffic cop)
3. Report out the status of the queue

The irrigation controller also has three basic protections

1. Before turning on a zone, it requires all other zones to be off.  This is typical for an irrigation controller to maintain water pressure to the system
2. The system needs to know when to turn off, even if communication with the cloud is lost.
3. If power goes out, the controller reverts to off


The code for the Arduino has the following features:

Creates a queue to turn on or off a specific zone or all zones

* The queue holds the state for each zone: 0=off, 1=waiting, 2=on
* A traffic cop feature ensures only one zone is running at once
* Works with up to 16 zones (relays), although you can use less
* Allows zone times to be communicated as a string, which is parsed into an array
* Once a zone is turned on, the Arduino knows when to turn it off (no additional communication needed)
* Utilizes a timer function to run the zones.  This keeps the CPU free to manage communication between Arduino and SmartThings while a zone is running
* When wired correctly, the system turns off when power goes off and stays off until new commands are sent from SmartThings

#### The Arduino IDE Software

Ok now head on over to http://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software and download the Arduino Interactive Developer Environment (IDE). Download the latest version.  Open the software, you will notice that it automatically creates a sketch with the date as part of the name.   That  is fine it’s just an automatic name based on your computer date.  Erase any code that automatically comes up on the window, you do not need it for this.To load the code onto the Arduino, you will need the Arduino developer environment:

#### The Libraries

Once the software is installed, the first thing to do is obtain the required libraries.  

* Timer library was created by Simon Monk as modified by JChristensen  
You need to get this https://github.com/JChristensen/Timer, just click on download zip as before. Rename the zip file to “Timer.zip” and extract it. Now go into the extracted folder and rename the folder ”Timer-Master” to “Timer”. It is this folder that you will use to upload the Timer.cpp to the Arduino Libraries, you must upload the entire folder as it also uses Event.cpp.

* Go to http://cl.ly/ZMHh and download the SmartThings Thing Shield library. Extract it, this will give you a folder structure of Shield Library/Shield Library/SmartThings it is this SmartThings folder you will be using to upload the libraries to the Arduino.

* SoftwareSerial library was default library provided with Arduino IDE.  It was automatically uploaded to the Arduino IDE.  Do nothing here.

#### Installing The Libraries

In the Arduino IDE, use the menus to go to Sketch | Include Library | Add .ZIP library… it will open a select library dialogue box, find your “Timer” folder (Select the folder not individual files) that you downloaded select it and click open to install the library.

Go to Sketch | Include Library | Add .ZIP library… it will open a select library dialogue box, find your “SmarrtThings” folder (Select the folder not individual files) you downloaded the one you extracted from the Shield library zip file select it and click open to install the library.

Verify Library uploads, Go to sketch | Include Library and you will now see the Timer and SmartThingsLibraries, as well as the SoftwareSerial library.

Now all your Libraries are loaded and ready to be compiled along with the Arduino code (Arduino_8_Zone_Irrigation_Controller.ino). This is done automatically because the Arduino code has includes statements (#include) that will load the libraries.


#### Load the Arduino Code

Start up the Arduino IDE.  Connect your Arduino to the computer via the USB cut and paste all the code from “Arduino_16_Zone_Irrigation_Controller.ino” that you downloaded into a window within the IDE.

**** Important:  Within the IDE, make sure you got to Tools | Board and select the correct Arduino Board.  For the 16 Zone Arduino, the recommended board is the  “Arduino Mega 2560”

Make sure the COM port is set correctly , you can got to Tools | serial Monitor and see where your Board is (what com is it on)

Go to To sketch | Upload, once uploaded you are done programming the Arduino.
 
Once you have finished transfering the code to the Arduino, you can remove the USB and power the Arduino using a 9V transformer.

Its more than a good idea to put a piece of electrical tape over the USB port to prevent accidental grounding of the port!


### Pair The SmartThings Shield (Arduino) To The SmartThings Hub

Pairing instructions for the Arduino to the SmartThings hub can be found at SmartThings.com and are copied here:

“To join the shield to your SmartThings hub, go to “Add SmartThings” mode in the
SmartThings app by hitting the “+” icon in the desired location, and then press the Switch button on the shield. You should see the shield appear in the app.

To unpair the shield, press and hold the Switch button for 6 seconds and release. The shield will now be unpaired from your SmartThings Hub.”


### Install The Device Handler Code 

Go to your browser and connect to api.graph.smartthings.com.  Once on the site, go to My Device Handlers page.  Click on the "+" and add a new Device Handler.  Select "Add From Code".   Simply copy and paste the code from file **Device_Type_16_Zone_Irrigation_Controller_.groovy**

Now hit "Save" and very importantly, press the "Publish" then "for me" buttons.  

Once you have saved and published the Device Handler, go to My Devices in St IDE , select the Arduino which is usually listed as “SmartThings Shield” and edit the Device Type and select your device handler.  Look for the default name “Arduino_16_Zone_Irrigation_Controller" or whatever name you may have given it.


The device type code allows you to control the Arduino via the SmartThings physical graph.  The Irrigation controller device type code has the following features:

The Main Tile is an all on or all off tile and links to the “switch” capability to turn on or off all 8 zones of the sprinkler by pressing one button.  By using the “switch” capability, you to use any of the SmartThings apps that includes a switch capability to run the sprinkler system!  There is also an “switch off” capability that turns off all zones. The Main Tile can also receive a message when the system is on Rain Delay mode.

Once you enter the Device Handler (Device Type), you will see the following screen:

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/15095947/40f74308-14a8-11e6-9435-1a79f4e156d3.jpg" width="200px"  />

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/15095948/430c53fe-14a8-11e6-834a-14a10b350182.jpg" width="200px"  />


Each sprinkler zone additionally has its own tile.  When the zone is off, the tile is white.  If the zone is in the queue and waiting its turn, the tile is gold.  When the zone is running, the tile is blue.

The “Refresh” tile can be pressed to refresh the status of all the zones.  There are a number of situations that the tiles become out of synch.  If you press too many individual tiles to fast, the communication may not be captured by the Arduino.  If you try to add or delete a zone from the queue while “refresh” is running (it takes 8 sec to refresh), the communication may not be captured by the Arduino.  And there are times the SmartThings hub just doesn’t seem to capture the message from the Arduino or at least is slow to respond.  If in doubt, press the “Refresh”.   As an additional "rescue" feature, any tile that seems to be out of synch can be pressed again to trigger the zone to turn off.  

Scheduler Override Tile.  This tile interacts with the Schedular App (see below) to provide additional functionality.  By pressing the tile you can rotate through the features
* Normal - allows Schedular App to run as scheduled
* Skip 1X - skips one scheduled watering routine
* Expedite - over-rides the weather forecast and allows the Schedule to run, even if there is rain
* Pause - indefinitely pauses the Scheduler App.  

Example uses for this Scheduler Overide tile include putting the system on hold for the winter, during yard construction projects, after applying weed killer to the yard, and so on.

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/15092468/dc467298-1430-11e6-8759-04b14c4028a6.jpg" width="200px"  />


The “Preferences” page allows you to enter the run times for each station.  To get to the preferences page, press the sprocket in the top right corner of the Device Handler:

**Important: You need to enter default times for each zone to run in manual mode.  Click on the "sprocket" icon in the top right.  This will bring up the Device Handler Configuration Screen where you can enter the manual run times.**

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/15133525/2d4f5016-1629-11e6-9ec7-1df71f003c68.jpg" width="200px"  />

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/15092466/d788e830-1430-11e6-99c9-c9fb5a0eab14.jpg" width="200px"  />


Once in the Preferences page, you can enter a set of times for each zone that you trigger manually (by pressing the zone tile in the Device Handler).  To enter you manual zone times, just enter the times in minutes.  If you are using less than 16 zones, just enter zero minutes for zones not in use.  These time Preferences are used when you run the sprinkler manually from within the Irrigation Controller Device Type app.  (Note: you will also have the opportunity to enter run times for each automatic watering schedule you set up.  This will be done later in the Smart App).  You can also rename your device and upload an image for a custom look.

### Install The Irrigation Scheduler SmartApp

Go to your browser and connect to api.graph.smartthings.com.  Once on the site, go to My SmartApps page.  Click on the "+" and add a new SmartApp.  Select "Add From Code".   Simply copy and paste the code from file **IrrigationSchedulerApp.groovy**

Now hit "Save" and very importantly, press the "Publish" then "for me" buttons.  

Once you have saved and published the SmartApp, you are ready to create your first irrigation schedule.  On your smartphone go to Marketplace | Smart Apps | and scroll down to My Apps and select install or configure the Irrigation Scheduler.

The SmartApp is where we put the brains in the system.

This SmartApp provides flexibility to schedule by days and/or by interval.  If you use both days and interval, you can take advantage of interval watering and avoid certain days, such as mowing days or days banned by your local ordinances.  The app also allows up to three watering times per day.

During set up mode, the app will also ask for zone watering times.  Times entered in the SmartApp will over-ride times entered in the device-handler preferences when using the SmartApp to schedule. **NOTE: if one or more zone times are configured in the app, only those zones with times will run**.  If no zone times are entered in the SmartApp, the zone times manually entered into your device handler will run.

The App will also ask for a zipcode.  We use the zipcode to look up your hyperlocal weather forecast to the your irrigation controller.  You can also enter the address of a specific WeatherUnderground weather station.   In essence, we use the local weather stations to take a snapshot of the rainfall on your lawn for roughly a 48 hour window, using the precip that fell the day before, the precip that fell that day and the forecasted precip for the remainder of the day.  After totaling up the precip, the App checks the threshold that you set as a preference.  If the precip exceeds the threshold, the App skips that watering.  Automagic!

We also pull the forecasted high temperature for the day.  This allows you to set a minimum threshold temperature before an irrigation will start.  For example, you could use 50F (default) and the system will not run on cool days when the grass is not growing or during winter.  Another suggestion is to create a second instance (install the app a second time) and only run when temperature hits 100F.  This gives your lawn a second watering only on hot days.  Very cool!


<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/3353742/3480941e-fa8b-11e3-935b-c485a2c88461.jpg" width="200px"  />

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/3353744/361a6372-fa8b-11e3-8fe5-1f1081f49fc2.jpg" width="200px"  />


As mentioned above, you can install multipe Scheduler apps.  For example one to run your lawn sprinklers every day and another to run your drip sprinklers a couple times of week.  Or whatever unique situation exists with your system.
  

## Take Your Controller to the Next Level:

We modified our Device Type command set to be compatible with the Virtual Switch capability by Jonathan (jwsf on github or badgermanus on SmartThings).  This allows you to virtualize each of the 8 zones giving enhanced ecosystem capabilities.  Virtualizing gives each zone its own “switch” capability that can be recognized within SmartThings ecosystem. Then you can start linking irrigation zones to all the SmartApps that link switches to other devices.  


Here is how to virtualize your switches:

1. Log into graph.api.smartthings.com
2. Go to "My Device Types"
3. Create a new SmartDevice, filling out the required info to create the device
4. Paste in the VirtualSwitch.groovy code from jwsf:  https://github.com/d8adrvn/device-type.arduino-8-way-relay/blob/master/VirtualSwitch.groovy
5. Save and Publish (for me)
6. Go to My SmartApps and create a new SmartApp
7. Paste in the code for the VirtualSwitchParent.groovy that has been modified to recoginize our Irrigation Controller.  The modified code can be found at:   https://github.com/d8adrvn/device-type.arduino-8-way-relay/blob/master/VirtualSwitchParent.groovy
8. Save and Publish (for me)
9. Go to My Devices and create a new Device.
10. Give it a 'name' and a 'label' such as "Virtual Irrigation Zone #1"
11. Under 'type', select "virtual switch", which is the device type you created in #4 above
12. For 'version', select "published"
13. Now repeat this 7 more times for each of your zones!

The above is a bit tedious.  As soon as SmartThings supports child devices, I imagine we will update our code and can do away with the need to create virtual switches.  

Now for the cool part.  You can integrate the sprinkler system with other SmartThings devices.  See below for some examples:

You can use the **Aeon Labs MiniMote** to wirelessly turn on and then off individual zones.  This is great if you do not have your iPhone or if you have a repair person working on your system.  The repair person just needs the MiniMote to switch the zones.  No running back and forth to the garage to advance the system!!!!!!!To control your system with the Aeon MiniMote:
1. Add the MiniMote to the sytem using Aeon's instructions "Becoming a Secondary/Inclusion Controller to Another Z-Wave Controller or Gateway in an Existing Z-Wave Network
2. When it asks you to configure 'button 1': add Virtual Irrigation Zone 1  as the switch under 'Pushed' and Virtual Irrigation Zone 2 as the switch under 'Held'
3. Repeat for buttons 2,3,4 using zones 3-8

Now when you 'push' or 'hold' a MiniMote button, the corresponding zone will activate.  If you push again, it will turn off.   If you do not turn off the sytem, it will run for as long as the zone ran, the last time it was activated from the device type or the smart app.   Tip: you can tell push and hold apart.  When you push, a solid blue led comes on.  When you have 'held' the button, the blue led starts flashing.  

To control your system with the **Amazone Echo**, just import your SmartThings devices into Echo.  The Sprinkler system will show up as an on/off switch which will trigger the sprinkler to run through each station using the manual zone times (the ones set in the preferences).  If you set up virtual switches for each zone, then you can use the Echo to turn on a specific zone.  Just say Alexa, turn on my Sprinkler system!

You can also use your sprinkler system as a first line of defense.  For example, you can use the "Turn on when there is motion" SmartApp to connect an irrigation zone to a motion detector and trigger the sprinkler every time deer or intruder enters that zone!



## FAQs

* You have just finished the project and are ready to try turning on a zone for the first time.  With great trepidation, you press the Zone 1 tile and it turns to "Sending..." but nothing else happens.  You are trying to turn on the system for zero minutes.  This is the most common question from the community.  Press on the "sprocket" in the top right corner of the Device Handler.  This takes you to the "preferences page".  You must enter a time (in minutes) for each of your active zones.  (Note: you will also get to enter zone times for each automatic schedule that you create.  These are entered seperately within the SmartApp).  

* After installing the Device Type or the Smart App, be sure to both Save AND Publish (for me).  If you do not publish, they will not be able to communicate with the hub.  If you make changes to either code, Publish early and often to avoid IDE issues.

* After powering off the Arduino or switching from USB power to 9V power, you may notice that the SmartShield LED goes dark.  The SmartShield LED will relight at the first activity and then function normally after that.  The Arduino LEDs should both be on at all times when power is supplied to the hardware

* What if you want to run your lawn irrigation on a different schedule than your drip irrigation?  No problems.  Just install the Irrigation Scheduler App for your lawn (rename it something like Lawn Irrigation Scheduler) and install the app a second time for the drip irrigation (rename it something like Drip Irrigation Scheduler).  

* The Arduino runs on 5V=9V DC power.  The sprinkler valves run on 24V AC power which is connected and daisy chained through the relays.  Be sure to keep them straight.  

*  There is nothing that requires you to have all 16 relays.  If you choose to use less than 16 relays AND plan to use the optional software activated master pump relay, just be sure that pin36 from the Arduino Mega is attached to the relay associated with the Master Pump Relay.
